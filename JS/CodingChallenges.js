 Coding Challenge - 3
 
 1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data
    below.
 2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the 
    competition, and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can
    be a draw, so test for that as well (draw means they have the same
    average score).
 
 Test Data 1: Sharks score 96, 108 and 89. Hammer_heads score 88, 91 and 
              110.
 Test Data 2: Sharks score 97, 112 and 101. Hammer_heads score 109, 95
              and 123.

  - Your task is to calculate the tip, depending on the bill value.
    Create a variable called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an 
    if/else statement.
  - Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and
    the final value (bill + tip).
    Example: 'The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 
    316.25'
  - Test data: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430.
